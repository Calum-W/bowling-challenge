Bowling Challenge
=================

As the weekend challenge for my fifth week at Makers' Academy, I was asked to complete a bowling scoring app, based on the following instructions.

## The Task

Count and sum the scores of a bowling game for one player (in JavaScript).

A bowling game consists of 10 frames in which the player tries to knock down the 10 pins. In every frame the player can roll one or two times. The actual number depends on strikes and spares. The score of a frame is the number of knocked down pins plus bonuses for strikes and spares. After every frame the 10 pins are reset.


### Optional Extra

* Create a nice interactive animated interface with jQuery.
